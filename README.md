<h3> Description: </h3>
Creating a simple Discord bot for some fun. I'm curious to see what I can do with it. We'll see how far this project goes.


<h3> Current commands: </h3>

1. Hi: greets user in the same language (english, polish, japanese)
   * Ex: !hi, !czesc, !ohayo
2. RandomUser: Chooses a random user on the server (can even choose yourself)
   * Ex: !randomUser, !randUser, !ru
3. FlipCoin: Flips a coin and shows heads or tails
   * Ex: !flipCoin, !flip, !fc, !coinFlip
